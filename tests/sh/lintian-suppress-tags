## Cannot be fixed due to Rust crate conventions

# crates don't generally have GPG signatures
debian-watch-does-not-check-gpg-signature
# crates don't always have a homepage
no-homepage-field
# crates don't always have tests
missing-tests-control
# crates sometimes just have long source lines

## Not to be fixed, due to how we package Rust in Debian and lintian being presumptuous

# we install the crate into /usr/share/cargo, including most docs

# we install the crate into /usr/share/cargo, lintian is overzealous

# this is a result of how we have to do rust packaging -

## Not to be fixed, due to our test setup

# this is because we don't bother with excluding embedded libs in this
# integration test. they are not allowed in Debian and would be a FTP reject
# but we don't care for the purposes of this integration test
